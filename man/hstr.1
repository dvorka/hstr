.TH HSTR 1
.SH NAME
\fBhstr\fR \-  easily view, navigate, sort and use your command history with shell history suggest box. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hstr [option] [arg1] [arg2]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hstr
uses shell history to provide suggest box like functionality
for commands used in the past. By default it parses .bash-history
file that is filtered as you type a command substring. Commands 
are not just filtered, but also ordered by a ranking algorithm
that considers number of occurences, length and timestamp. 
Favorite and frequently used commands can be bookmarked. In addition
\fBhstr\fR allows removal of commands from history - for instance with a typo 
or with a sensitive content.
