.TH HH 1
.SH NAME
\fBhh\fR \-  easily view, navigate, sort and use your command history with shell history suggest box. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hh [option] [arg1] [arg2]... 
.RS 0
.B hstr [option] [arg1] [arg2]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hh
uses shell history to provide suggest box like functionality
for commands used in the past. By default it parses .bash-history
file that is filtered as you type a command substring. Commands 
are not just filtered, but also ordered by a ranking algorithm
that considers number of occurences, length and timestamp. 
Favorite and frequently used commands can be bookmarked. In addition
\fBhh\fR allows removal of commands from history - for instance with a typo 
or with a sensitive content.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fB~/.hh_favorites\fR 
 Bookmarked favorite commands.
.TP
\fB~/.hh_blacklist\fR 
 Command blacklist.

.SH BASH CONFIGURATION
Optionally add the following lines to ~/.bashrc:
.nf
.sp
export HH_CONFIG=hicolor         # get more colors
shopt -s histappend              # append new history items to .bash_history
export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace   # leading space hides commands from history
export HISTFILESIZE=10000        # increase history file size (default is 500)
export HISTSIZE=${HISTFILESIZE}  # increase history size (default is 500)
export PROMPT_COMMAND="history \-a; history \-n; ${PROMPT_COMMAND}"
# if this is interactive shell, then bind hh to Ctrl-r (for Vi mode check doc)
if [[ $\- =~ .*i.* ]]; then bind '"\eC\-r": "\eC\-a hh -- \eC-j"'; fi
.sp
.fi
The prompt command ensures synchronization of the history between BASH memory 
and history file.
.SH ZSH CONFIGURATION
Optionally add the following lines to ~/.zshrc:
.nf
.sp
export HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history   # ensure history file visibility
export HH_CONFIG=hicolor         # get more colors
bindkey -s "\eC\-r" "\eeqhh\en"  # bind hh to Ctrl-r (for Vi mode check doc, experiment with --)
.sp
