.TH HH 1
.SH NAME
\fBhh\fR \- shell history suggest box
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hh [option] [arg1] [arg2]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hh
uses shell history to provide suggest box like functionality
for commands used in the past. By default it parses .bash-history
file that is filtered as you type a command substring. Commands 
are not just filtered, but also ordered by a ranking algorithm
that considers number of occurences, length and timestamp. 
Favorite and frequently used commands can be bookmarked. In addition
hh allows removal of commands from history - for instance with a typo 
or with a sensitive content.

.nf
.sp
export HH_CONFIG=hicolor         # get more colors
shopt -s histappend              # append new history items to .bash_history
export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace   # leading space hides commands from history
export HISTFILESIZE=10000        # increase history file size (default is 500)
export HISTSIZE=${HISTFILESIZE}  # increase history size (default is 500)
export PROMPT_COMMAND="history \-a; history \-n; ${PROMPT_COMMAND}"
# if this is interactive shell, then bind hh to Ctrl-r

The prompt command ensures synchronization of the history between BASH memory 
and history file.
