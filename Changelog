  * Released v2.0.0 - Major release which resolves confusing hstr/hh ambuiguity by choosing
    hstr to be the only name used. hh becomes just a shell alias. Therefore this release
    introduces backward incompatible changes: all HH_ starting environment variables were
    changed to HSTR_, similarly configuration file names starting with .hh_ were renamed to start
    with .hstr_, identifiers used in HSTR_CONFIG were changed e.g. favorites to favorites-view.
    Please check man page for details and update your 1.x.x configuration.
        Ubuntu package name was changed - use: apt install hstr. Tarball name has been changed as
    well to have hstr prefix - please update your scripts.
        Additional improvements: all memory leaks fixed, long commands handling improved (...), bash
    autocomplete added.
