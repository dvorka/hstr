# Travis CI

**DECOMISSIONED** after Travis CI scan of all my organizations libraries
with no option to disable such behavior, inability to remove 
organizations from Travis CI account, forcing commertial plans regardless
intended use for my FLOSS project(s) only.

Production `travis-ci.yml` file would be located in the root 
of GitHub repository.

Bye bye Travis CI!
